Nice product but could be cheaper
Nice product
Good
The product quality and working and all fine. But this will not help in the log run..If you can spend some more money to get a advanced board which will have barometer and GPS capabilities..This board will help us to fly but it is unstable as is lack some needed sensors so this will not lock in one place.. Drone is big so it's dangerous to have it unstable.Got cut by the blades many times. Drone Also fell many times
Ok
Good product works good with 10'' propellers also. Nicely fits below the motors.If the bolts were a little bit longer like 1-2mm it would have been better.Overall a good product
"With a slight modification, it is the best available, just stick approriate lenght barbeque sticks in the bottom groove to have a perfect guard"

"The box arrived on time, however it seems the motor and lighting components were taken out from the package and left alone with the box.The nightmare now is the servo does not work and I am unable to reach the seller.Hope they see this a connect with me"
"Absolutely terrible, came with some small parts missing. How are you supposed to build a car with missing parts?"
Very low quality charger and battery. I am very disappointed.
"everything in this kit is the poorly made in china kinds. The wires are total junk, the resistors are total crap, The battery holder is cheap plastic,the whole kit is worth less than ?200 when made in large quantities.The only thing good about this kit is the PCB and the 2 100uF electrolytic capacitors. The manual is in chinese, and luckily since I have a good background in electronics, I could get it to work. The heart of this circuit a ?15 LM393 comparator looks so cheapThe biggest joke is that they say its MRP is ?1048. For just about ?1000, you can pick up a Arduino based kit with a motor controller, IR sensor unitMy review is not about the seller - I don't know them. Its about this product, and I want you to be conscious of this product.Stay away from this - Just don't buy this junk - I have just warned you!"
Good for project but 2 motors making noise.
Nice awesome
Good for project but 2 motors making noise.
Nice awesome
"Pros: Its works.Cons: The motor locking thingie broke, on 3 piece 1 had crack in it... 1 motor had a big crack, which I had to glue it.I am using it anyways cos i dont have time to return and wait for replacement."
"The motors are works perfectly..but that rubber wheels are fitted uneven,But still good iteam in budget."
"Good product , affordable price and still working fine"
It works and wheel is bigger than expected
Very slow
I feel that this product is best for building a project which require wheel and motors
I always choose robocraze as the best choice t sometimes it may be costly and sometimes it may be cheap
"Motor terminals are of bad quality ,tyres are good"
Super wheels
Product is very good...but one Tyre is missing
"Good packaging , value for money nd of good quality"
These motors were really good for me. Now I can make RC toys.
Awesome product .
It's a very good product with Hugh quality
1 wheel is defective .Can I have a replacement?
2 of the motors are not working properly.
All motors were not working i have to open them and fix them individually. Also the gear of one motor was broken and was not working properly
"VERY Fantastic,running very goodly"
Nice
It looks awesome and comfortableGood money
Great product for my project.
Everything was good.. but one among the motor was broken..
Everything excellent. Good packaging. But if they peovide claim and screw along with these product. 5 star
Good quality

"Product quality is absolutely inconsistent. I bought 2 units of this from the same seller. I've supplied same amount of power to both the units, and yet one of them achieves 15 degrees on the cold side while the other doesn't go below 25 degrees. I'm highly unsatisfied with the product."
"No heating, no cooling after connecting with 12v5amp charger and using ample thermal grease between heat sink tried to test with normal connection and it blew up the +ve wire not can't use can't return money waste"
*Amazing product.*Good condition.*Good packing
Good. But. It's. Cooling. Not. As. Expect
It works super
Good
Peltier not working more then 1 hour.After continous usage for 1 hour neither it is heating nor cooling.Waste of money.....

"I am satisfy with the product, It met with my expectations.It is an invention kit for all the students"
Nice one
"Excelente producto, de verdad de los más estimulantes para el aprendizaje, promete desarrollo y puede partir de uno mismo ante la aplicación y desarrollo de softwares que exploten el potencial de esta pequeña bestia, excelente para todas las edades, aunque el manejor y operación debe ir supervisada por un adulto si se le da a un@ niñ@ pequeñ@"
Funciona tal y como explican en su web. El material parece de buena calidad.
"This is a great item to build DIY projects. Very small and compact, easy to set up and use, and clear to understand if you're familiar with electronics and circuitry.The major problem that I have is for the price point, I would expect at the very least to get some quality alligator clips to connect to the conductors. The springs in the clips don't put enough tension to even close, and they definitely don't hold on to what they're clipped to. I definitely expected more durable connectors, and will have to shop for more elsewhere."
"Makey Makey kit was what my kids needed to bridge the gap between computer programming and HMI.I have tried using other more advanced products like arduino, but the complexity scared my kids away. Makey drove simplicity and an easy to understand approach that was easily adaptable to almost anything the kids dreamed of.I was afraid the kit would not offer enough to keep them entertained for long. However with the adaptability of the product we quickly found ways to keep this going for hours. My boys continue to enjoy this and ask to bring it out occasionally."
We purchased 5 of these for our elementary school and the cords that go from the board to the computer do not fit. When I tried using a regular Makey Makey cord then the board did not work.  Spoke to people at Makey Makey and they said these were fake. Now we are stuck with 5 boards that do not work.Updated Review:Found out that these were fake makey boards. A person from Joy Labz contacted me and totally replaced fake boards. They were wonderful to rectify this problem. In the future I would only buy these from the Makey Makey site. Thanks Makey Makey!!

"I have seen this little gizmo at maker faires, at my son's school and so on and saw how it sparked interest in my son.  It is so easy to plug into a computer and start making key presses.  There are a ton of websites where this can be used as an input, and it's fun to watch kids use different items for input or test to see if they are conductive.  So many possibilities for learning!"
"Intramontabile. Regalato ad un bimbo di 10 anni che ha iniziato subito a giocarci, creare e divertirsi sperimentando i vari materiali e le varie applicazioni."
Loved the creative abilities this Makey Makey can offer. Endless possibilities for extending g learning. My 5th graders connected homemade robots to their projects created in Scratch. One broke where the USB needed to be attached with less than 2 weeks use. A similar product available for 1/2 the price.
One of the absolute best gadgets that I have added to my classroom. You will lose yourself with all the possibilities. I cant wait to raise the funds to buy a class set

"I had a hard time finding a good Xmas gift for my 20 year old brother who is a programming student. This little device which, as robust as it is, comes packed in a box the size of two card decks. He wasn't quite sure what to make of it at first, but once I told him about the forums and groups dedicated to this device he was elated.There are limitless possibilities for creating new and innovate inventions. When everyone else may be gifting ""smart phones"", tablets and countless other electronic devices that distract us from our inventive engine, this gift is perfect for getting someone to once again explore their creative side through a fun, interactive hands-on process."
Bought it as a gift for my granddaughter who was introduced to this item at school.  Her birthday was just around the corner and she wanted one.  She likes it  - Ive never seen it in action but appreciate the interest she showed in wanting one.  Very good example of hands-on learning for conductivity.
"The Makey Makey is a great way to introduce someone to the world of electronics. The possibilities with this thing are endless. From music to games and much more the Makey Makey provides an interactive medium that makes learning about STEM and electronics fun at all ages. It is easy to set up, there are a bunch of guides out there on different applications, and skills you will learn while using this could allow you to further your skills to more challenging projects."
"C'est juste génial !Essayer avec vos enfants (ou ceux des autres si vous n'en avez pas ! Ou même tout seul d'ailleurs !)Avec des bananes, de la pâte à modeler, etc.."
it was an amazing toy. my son loves it. i think it is an amazing gift for a birthday party or anybody.  it was amazing.
"Richiesto come regalo, è stato molto gradito. Ottima la spedizione e gli imballi"
Outstanding product. So easy and so much fun for the kids while they learn about technology. A top pick for STEM products. Can be accessed using SCRATCH programming. And can be expanded by adding Arduino piggy back board to make limitless projects.STEM Project shown features Makey Makey GO integrated to Art.... This is STEAM project. Mayor Tecklenberg of Charleston SC shown with young inventor.
"Conforme à la description et à l'original mais arrivé avec 1 semaine de retard avec le vendeur cool componentsLe produit en lui-même est fun, facile à utiliser/comprendre même pour les novices et a bcp plu (cadeau à un jeune de 24 ans)"
Easy to understand instructions.  Grandson has taken basic coding classes so he is thrilled with it!
"This is a hilarious little gadget! I've used it to make a couple of things shown in the promo video (gameboy console, fruit drums, cat camera). It really is versatile & can be used to make just about anything. I've ordered some extra cables to turn the stairs into a keyboard; worked perfectly. Really good gift idea for someone who likes to tinker with gadgets; and has a great imagination!!! Would highly recommend."
"This has been the hit of the spring with the kids.  We've had musical bananas, a sandwich space bar, water balloon instruments and a few other crazy shenanigans.  How this will become an instrument for the talent show this year is yet to be determined, but I see it coming - and can't wait.  This is exactly the hands-on, creative and critical thinking kids need."
So I saw someone using this in Wales and thought it was cheap enough and fun enough I would get one to play with.  It came quickly and a literally tossed to my 13 year old daughter as I was running out for an errand.  When I came back she had alligator clip on her toe and was touching pennies on other clips to control youtube videos.Next up is to use it with my Raspberry Pi computer and REAL raspberries...
Excellent tool for a project I was working on. I made a piano puzzle using a real upright piano and the Makey-Makey with alligator clips. Quick assembly and excellent performance. Just make sure you understand which button you are attaching to or you might accidentally code the mouse as a keypad press. This was great!
Just wanted to rest test it out for a little while before writing a review. It works great! Once you get the hang of how it works. I used it to build a family fued buzzer everyone loves it. And it shipped fast. Thanks seller!
This kit is very fun and creative. I've never seen anything like it. It's so easy to use that kids could easily use it pretty independently. The only drawback for me is the price.
"I had never heard of this before, but my 9 yr. old grandson wanted it for Christmas. Two family members got it for him and he was beyond thrilled. This is great for the future engineer."
My son received this for his 7th birthday and loved it! Its easy to use. The instructions gave simple directions he could do himself. It even came with 3 ideas to get him started. The makey makey website also has lots of fun ideas for him to try. Would highly recommend!
"Para trabajar con los niños de mi academia, les encantó la idea de trabajar con el makey makey en la computadora"
"oh dear God. my husband won't stop playing with it. and then our 10 year old daughter ordered one. this thing is HOURS of fun. we even had a digitally scored sword fight with wrapping paper tubes, and had a banana scream ""ow"" when we cut it. our dog was confused why he kept meowing when we pet him."
Exactly as described- lots of fun for young and old.
I love this!! Theyre easy to use! My students love it as well. Kids can easily use
"Got this as a Christmas present for our kids, my son had a science fair and they were using one of these, they really liked it and had a blast hooking it up to bananas and paper to make a working keyboard from the computer."
This was a great purchase for my 10 yr old daughter. She is really into computers and programing. A+++ product
We've only dabbled but I can see how this product has amazing potential. My son was thrilled to get it on xmas.
"At my University I gave this to students. They had so much fun that,  well, I'm not getting it back anytime soon. The beauty of this is it's not some prepackaged toy that limits imagination, it opens the imagination. There is more fun and learning in this tiny rectangle than a week ay Disney World."
The Makey Makey set is great for student learning.  We are using them for a class designed to teach teachers how to create makerspaces in their classrooms.  This product fits the bill for that.
My 14 yr old how hours of fun with this and a few friends.  It was nice to see them get creative and away from their cell phones :)
This kit is an ok product. I suppose it appeals to people who don't understand much about electricity. Everything this kit supplies costs about $10 total. They charge $50 so it's not at all a good value. As far as function it works precisely as described. You do need a computer to make this product work. Be sure to check your operating system to make certain that Makey Makey will work with your computer. Overall the product is decent but not worth the money.
Uno de los mejores inventos que he visto.
"Hours of fun, the possibilities are endless, the programming environment is easier then Microsoft Word to use, as it was design for kids but not so child-like, so  adults can use it too."
My husband bought this to make some game buzzers - it's really neat and fun for the whole family!  You can turn anything into a simple keyboard or mouse command.
Super fun & suprisingly easy to use
It's under the tree waiting for Christmas as we speak!
"L'anima della festa!Tutti sono stati entusiasti del regalo fatto a mia figlia...Sono riusciti in pochi minuti a far suonare non solo tutti gli oggetti, ma anche le persone che stavano intorno a loro.Tempi di consegna rispettati e nonostante la confezione sembri piccolissima, il contenuto è veramente eccezionale!"
After contacting the manufacturer I found out this was a counterfeit board. Unable to reassign inputs using the Makey Makey website.
Bueno lo tendré que preguntar era para un familiar y no se como le va. La próxima vez que lo ve le pregunto
Great item for Makerspaces or classrooms!  Upper elementary seems appropriate for age level.
"El producto está genial, aunque se echa en falta por el precio que vale más cables o cables con más longitud para que tengas más libertad de crear diversos proyectos."
Not sure. Purchased as gift. Child nor parents never acknowlaged?
expensive toy.
I bought this to teach programing with Scratch in my classroom. All my students  loved. I'm using it every week.
Kept our son busy for hours and hours. Well worth the investment for learning and fun.
Quick delivery and works well.
It kept my grandson happy for tree days
Confezione originale e prezzo vantaggioso
It is okey
propre plug in play novateur facile et ludique pleins de possibilité je recommande vraiment cet article pour les petit bidouilleur en herbe comme moi !
Great products for kids
A wonderfully straight-forward way to explore STEM/STEAM projects.
we love makey makey!! xo
Brilliant gadget.  Works just as advertised.
as advertised
Makey Makey is awesome!!!
great stuff
"All the sensors are of poor quality except Ultrasonic sensor.For other sensors either there is range issue, or sensor does not work as expected.Not worth the money as you will be mostly be disappointed to do anything with these useless sensors."

Just awesome....  All materials required provided inside the package. Good quality product. But disappointed ?? with a few things :1. The chassis of the robot had a big crack on its rear end.  [The package should have been marked handle with care]2. The motors don't come prepared wired.They could have soldered the wires to the motor instead of just giving them loose.Otherwise happy with the product.Although not tested the robot using the code...
The vendor is useless. The video is of no use as instruction given are not appropriate for building the Line follower. The instruction provided are too less for creating the same. The worst part is so said instruction paper is so dim printed that it is hard to understand. I would not recommend the buy from the buyer.
Item good but programmed is not mentioned this item that he is not work....
It's all perfect

2 wheels are having damaged tyres...
Worthless.
Good but not with hard case
"The product quality and application is very good, a must buy, got just for 464 and a 2 day delivery ¡!!!!!"
I used it for making my school project which was a robot and it worked more perfectly than I thought.Pros:Works properlyNice design tooTyres are big enoughTyres fit properly to the motorIt is hard and do not break easily????Cons :????No according to me
I used this for making a robot and it worked so well. The wheels are also thick enough and are madeof good quality rubber. It is worth of money. Don't think just buy
But a little too expensive
Nice but the motors we're very weak and light... Motor's plastic material is not good.

Broo i loved it soo much the best packaging experience i ever had. the camera was in extreme quality and the box had soo much warmth to it . I loved the product and i really would recommend to everyone searching for a raspberry pi cam. The quote on the top was kinda heartwarming.It has a good value for money too

good product....better clarity of video than imagined
Good quality pictures. But video is very slow. almost not usable.
The product is faulty and not working. Amazon does not replace it either.
Just plug in the camera and run the service on terminal and voila the camera works.
Fine enough for my purpose good product but one drawback is it doesn't click clear pictures much otherwise fine h
Even though it works well on testing.....I can't connect camera with Google meet ...That Google meet not found the camera ....... Please help me

Too expansive it's available in the market for 3200 pi4 2gb and other models also less thn that 4gb 8gb
Amazon products are getting expensive rest of the world is moving towards economic products.
This is a good product that allows to push ur pc
A great product!! Managed to cool down the my Pi 4B from mid-50°s to mid-30°s!! Also very silent!! Only suggestion would be for the manufacturer to add which face is the down one
"Absolutely excellent product which has been destroyed by not paying attention to the slot for the GPIO connector! The slot provided cannot accommodate an IDC connector! Fortunately, for my current application I do not need the GPIO connector. But for applications that will use it, I cannot buy this product. 4 stars for an otherwise 5 star product..."
"only problem with this metal case is, it distrot the wifi communication"

"I love it ,it's a cute piece of computer"
"Worked well but issues with supplythe card is asking for huge current , not sure if my card has problem or the supply is not good enoughWill try with a different supply and come back!"
The one which I received was absolutely genuine and also the price was a bit lower than the one sold on streets including GST ;)
They should have give a cheap case with it.
"It's a good SBC, Performance is better than RPi Model B.  Able to emulate Complex 3d N64 games and playstation games in RETROPIE emulator. But heats up a lot. Need to buy a heat sink"
"Very good, better than raspberry pi 3b. Ubuntu 16.04 mate till not launch for this board (officially declared by ubuntu). For accessing all facilities, you will have to install official raspbian system image. That is also better."
Genuine Pi soc board. The model B+ comes with a metal protection over the cpu chip. Very happy with seller and amazon delivery.
Quick Delivery. Product well packed and as described. The R pi is working perfectly.
"Good product, only buy from this Amazone dont buy from Robu.com because from Robu.com I have purchased 2 times and have got both the time faulty raspberry pi . And Robu.com didnt replaced the product and gave me silly explanations .same way in Amazone whenever I got any faulty product immediately they have replaced it."
Fake product. Dont buy
"Didn't work, got defective one, and it didn't have return policy"
"The RPI is very versatile. It's currently the brain box behind my make-shift garden irrigation system. It could be used for more or I could have used something simpler like an ESP8266, however, the RPI provides sooo much flexibility it's a no-brainer.Get the newer one if you can find it anywhere."
"I have had a midi keyboard laying around and I wanted to let my son be able to play without a device with a screen (laptop or tablet), so I decided to by a raspberry pi. I have dabbled around with Linux before and the installation process is super easy and straightforward and it has real vnc included so I can remote control from my phone hence no need for an external monitor. I have ardour installed and on all the time and the keyboard works like a regular piano. Brilliant.The only downside I've found is the included audio interface, when plugging in the speakers to the built in 3.5mm adapter, the latency is pretty high and doesn't work right if it's lowered. Luckily I have a many usb C to 3.5mm phone adapters which are actually audio cards with much less latency. I just needed an extra usb c to usb 3 adapter. Alternatively one of the cheapest regular usb sound cards on amazon could work as well.Highly recommended for any use where you might need something plugged in all the time and wastes a fraction of the energy of a tablet or laptop or desktop."
"Este producto es todo lo que un entusiasta de la tecnología podría desear, con é puedes llevar a cabo infinidad de proyectos a un precio más que asequible.Esta raspberry es la revisión de la B con lo que lleva unas pequeñas mejoras respecto a su predecesora como pueden ser mayor velocidad de procesador (1400Mhz respecto a 1200Mhz de la anterior), una conexión ethernet de mayor velocidad (300Mb respecto a 100 de su antecesora) y compatibilidad con las redes 5G de nuestros routers de fibra. Además el fabricante asegura que tiene una mejor gestión del calor.Dicho esto enumeraré lo que yo creo que son los pros y los contras.PROS:- Detrás de este producto hay una comunidad enorme con la que apoyarte y conseguir información.- Precio asequible.- Sirve para llevar a cabo una infinidad de proyectos.- Consumo mínimo.- Mejora algo la anterior.CONTRAS:- Sólo es la raspberry con lo que tendrás que comprar transformador, memoria, cables de red y HDMI (estos dos últimos no necesarios según el proyecto que quieras llevar a cabo) a parte y carcasa (no necesaria al 100% pero recomendabe), con lo que hace que el precio total ascienda a algo más.- Es un modelo relativamente reciente y puede que te de problemas con algún proyecto que en el modelo anterior no te daría.- En mi caso me llegó con 3 horas de uso con lo que me hace dudar seriamente que sea nueva.- Se hecha en falta una bolsa antiestática en el packing.Debido a que el producto me llegó con 3 horas de uso le resto una estrella ya que me hace dudar que me hayan vendido un producto de segunda mano."
"Einfach ein tolles Gerät,um mit der passenden Software einen 33D-Drucker anzusteuern und zu überwachen"
"Grazie ad Arduino e Raspberry, il mondo dei ""makers"", ovvero di quelle persone che ""inventano"" nuovi oggetti, è letteralmente esploso. Raspberry è un'ottimo punto di partenza anche perchè consente di utilizzare un vero e proprio minicomputer, in grado quindi di far girare anche programmi complessi, senza dover per forza di cose scrivere programmi ""ad hoc"".In Internet ci sono centinaia di progetti interessanti che coinvolgono Raspberry, e con meno di 40 Euro è possibile iniziare a ""giocare"" in questo fantastico parco giochi ;)Il prodotto, nello specifico, si presenta in una bella confezione con il logo Raspberry; è presente la scheda (ultimo modello, Pi3 B+) che è decisamente più potente del Pi2, e un piccolo manualetto di istruzioni ""quickstart"". Tutto il resto va acquistato a parte: monitor, dissipatori, schede aggiuntive di qualsiasi genere, ma già con la sola scheda è possibile installare una delle tante distribuzioni Linux e iniziare a trovare un progetto interessante da realizzare.Comoda la presenza di una porta HDMI, delle 4 USB, del WiFi e della porta Ethernet che lo rendono in effetti un vero micro-computer (pico computer, forse è meglio). Davvero intrigato, mi sto divertendo un casino!"
"I have been using Linux for nearly 30 years, and in that time, I used to have servers, old desktops, and old laptops setup as my learning/practice/mad scientist machines. These used a lot of electricity, produced a lot of heat, and were expensive to operate. Now, I have clusters of Pi's setup that use a fraction of the electricity and produce no discernible heat. There are so many things you can do with a Raspberry Pi: I won't list them here. My guess is that if you are looking to get one, you already know what you can do with it. If not, I suggest you look up Raspberry Pi Projects to get an idea. This little computer won't let you down. It's a great way to practice and learn new skills while keeping expenses low. Highly recommended."
"J'avais besoin d'un nouveau Raspberry pour me faire un MediaCenter, j'ai pris un Pi Zero mais il est dans certaines situations, comme les replay, il a quelque fois du mal.J'ai donc pris le Pi 3 B+ qui lui roxx du poney !! Le chargement des pages et beaucoup plus rapide et la navigation dans les vidéos est plus fluide.Petite remarque pour ceux, qui comme moi, on eu un problème de boot : C'EST NORMAL !!!Le fireware de Pi3 +b n'est pas le même que ses prédécesseurs, il faut donc bien prendre une distrib compatible Pi 3 B+ et non Pi2 ou Pi3b classique sinon pas de boot, l'écran arc en ciel reste figéJ'espère que ce conseil vous sera utile car j'ai vu dans les commentaires négatif que les gens avaient le problème mais ne chercher pas ils revoyaient le produit"
"He intentado algo muy básico, que era tener un navegador al que poder acceder de forma remota para salir a Internet con la IP de mi casa, y ha sido un fracaso absoluto.El sistema que he utilizado es raspbian, y quería utilizar chromium como navegador pero en cuanto entraba de forma remota la raspi se congelaba y la tenía que reiniciar, un fracaso para esta aplicación."
"There was absolutely nothing wrong with this product. I am undoubtably satisfied. It showed up on time, packed nicely, and it was very easy to setup. ( Following the instructions of course.) My only regret was not having enough money for a case and touch screen.  Maybe one day there will be a giveaway or promotion giving me the chance to have the full Raspberry Pi 3 B+ Element 14 experience.  Very great product from a very under appreciated seller. I would like to personally thank Canakit for providing this item for me. I know it sounds like im embelishing a bit,but this experience warrants it.  I would order 10 more if i had the funds.  Thank you again Canakit and Amazon as well."
"Prodotto che ha soddisfatto le mie aspettative. Devo confessare che mi ha fatto soffrire un pò all'inizio perchè non ho mai voluto installargli il SO ufficiale Raspbian (sono contrario e non mi piace) preferendo un sistema Slackware-arm che però richiede più interventi non troppo adatti ai neofiti. Però il risultato finale è meritevole. Ci sto lavorando ancora per arricchirlo di altre funzionalità. Devo dire che soffre un pò la concorrenza di altri prodotti che offrono (almeno sulla carta) alcune caratteristiche superiori (velocità RAM), anche se il supporto è molto più fornito (sebbene sia quasi esclusivamente concentrato su Raspbian e molto meno sugli altri sistemi operativi). Unico neo: nonostante i firmware ufficiali il bluetooth integrato sembra dare difficoltà su quasi tutti i sistemi operativi. Comunque un bel aggeggino con cui divertirsi un pò, a buon prezzo."
"I run OctoPi on this for my Ender 3. I also use it to stream 720p video and take timelapses using a Logitech C615 webcam pointed at my setup.I printed a wall mounted case for it, and threw on some cheap aluminum heatsinks and a 30mm fan running off the GPIO pins. Does the job awesome.Now I want to do a bunch of other sick projects based around the RasPi. It's a pretty amazing piece of hardware for the price."
"We found an old raspberry pi and were so excited to try out a few projects with it, unfortunately the perpheries didn't work anymore - but this new one works like charm. I managed to make the simpler projects first (blinking a LED, or create a doorbell) - quite fun for the lockdown times."
"Absolutely fantastic little system. Since moving to a completely different place than my hometown its been rough without much gaming options around me since my collection is up in my hometown stillSo, I needed an option for emulating all my favorites. And I may well say, I am greatly impressed that this thing emulates so well.On top of this, its a perfect silent media PC as well.Of all single board computers, this definitely has the best value, will be getting more for other projects in the future for sure."
"El modelo B+ mejora levemente al modelo B de Raspberry, aumentamos tan solo 100Mhz que no son muy importantes pero que en algun que otro uso para este pequeño ordenador lo vamos a notar. Concretamente el aumento de velocidad se nota muy levemente en los emuladores de consolas mas modernas.Otra de las mejoras y quiza la que mas he notado ha sido la temperatura al venir con el chip protegido con la chapa metalica, he pasado de 55º en el modelo B a 47ª en el modelo B+ teniendo colocado el mismo tipo de disipador y en la misma caja*VENTAJAS:- Mejora de rendimiento levemente respecto a la versión B a secas- Mejora en la temperatura del procesador- El WIFI interno tiene una mayor cobertura y alcance*DESVENTAJAS:- A mi parecer deberian haber puesto este modelo al precio del modelo B a secas y el anterior bajarlo de precio"
"Utilisé pour en faire- une station d'émulation pour la TV du salon : tout simplement un pur bonheur : rapide, puissant etc... quasiment tout passe et aucun ralentissement. Reconnaissance du réseau en direct/wifi sans aucun soucis. Utilisation de stick arcade / souris / clavier (microsoft & Mac) sans aucun soucis ... bref : génial !- comme Steam link : pouvoir jouer à des jeux du PC (dans le bureau) sur TV 65 pouces OLED sans le moindre ralentissement (PC musclé quand même hein) c'est un pur bonheur !Bref : je recommande à 100%"
"Ho acquistato il P3 B+ per farne un piccolo server per la gestione centralizzata dei backup su dischi USB delle macchine in rete utilizzando rsync. Il risultato è fantastico! ottima la velocità di trasferimento, anche in ssh, grazie alla connessione ethernet a 1Gb ed al processore che adempie pienamente ai propri compiti. Ed il tutto con un consumo irrisorio!Con l'ottimo Raspbian può essere anche preso in considerazione per sostituire un desktop a cui non si richieda troppo.Unico suggerimento, nell'acquistare il necessario case scegliere un kit con i 3 dissipatori, in quanto i chips tendono a scaldare abbastanza.Ne ho subito acquistato un secondo per sperimentare ulteriormente."
"Raspberry è un'ottima marca di computer a scheda singola. lo uso per applicazioni molto basilari ad esempio il gioco su retroemulatori (e si può giocare senza problemi anche alla playstation 1).la confezione arriva molto scarna e, nota molto negativa, arriva senza l'imballaggio adatto (busta antistatica).nonostante questo inconveniente il prodotto funziona e anche bene."
"I love Pi's. This was the 3rd one that I had purchased and it was as every bit as good as the other 2 I have gotten in the past. My pi's see many projects in their lifetime and they always handle them like champions. VPN, DNS server, webserver, retroPi, Python Dev environment, ect. I've done it all and they always hold up without being too short on specs or getting too hot. I love them."
"Not a lot to say, its a functional Raspberry Pi 3B+ but i do think it should come with heat sinks, no PSU is OK, but heat-sinks is just an additional required purchase which bumps the final price."
"Rien à redire sur cette nouvelle version du Raspberry qui ira se loger dans un boitier RetroFlag SuperPi pas encore arrivé.Par contre, l'emballage du colis est inacceptable, la petite boite du Raspberry est juste glissée dans une enveloppe cartonnée par Amazon.  Aucune protection contre l'écrasement ou les objets pointus qui pourraient transpercer l'emballage.J'ai pris peur en voyant le colis et la boite du Raspberry tout écrasée, mais miraculeusement, il ne semble pas avoir de dégât sur la carte elle  même...Amazon m'avait habitué à mieux protéger ses colis, d'ailleurs il semble que la page pour ""noter"" les emballages a disparu depuis quelques temps."
"You cant go wrong with a Pi.I just love it. I preferred to by the motherboard alone and other element separately. You save few $$ and dont end up with stuff you already have.Power supply for instance is not necessary as now you probably have in your house tons of USB power adapters. Just having a USB cable is more versatile, if you move to different countries."
What can I say? Excellent for messing around with. Should have bought a Pi years ago to get my geek on but they were limited in connectivity. For my projects it feels fast enough. Connecting with VNC over wifi shows no noticeable lag. This feels like a real computer but tiny.One word of warning - you will need a decent PSU - 2.5a is more than most charger plugs deliver.I can't see why anyone would want to save a few quid to get an older one. Just get this.
"It works as it should but, they really should change the listing picture. It's not blue; it's green."
Un PC in miniatura in cui installare un sistema operativo Raspbian e Dar vita a qualsiasi progetto più o meno legato al mondo dell' elettronica. Lo si può anche semplicemente usare per creare una piccola console o un progetto retro gaming.
"Este nuevo modelo B+ se calienta bastante más que el anterior B (sin plus). Más rápida que el anterior, un USB más veloz y una pseudo-gigabit ethernet, hacen que este modelo merezca la pena si pretendes adquirir una nueva, pero no para cambiar si tienes la anterior.Muy, muy recomendable un buen disipador o tendrás una bonita tostadora en poco tiempo si le das caña."
"Hmm,das gleiche ist mir damals schon mit dem C64 und C128 passiert. Ich hätte nicht gedacht, das es so ist aber leider funktioniert der aktuelle Retropie Emulator mit dem 3B+ (noch?) nicht.Ich war schon etwas entsetzt, als die rote LED nur blinkte (4x lang, 4x kurz).Tante Google hatte auch noch keine Antwort zu verzeichnen.Der Verkäufer gab mir den Hinweis, die aktuellste Software zu benutzen.Zum Beispiel:2018-03-13-raspbian-stretch oder NOOBS_v2_7_0.Tadaaa - es funktioniert.Ich hoffe mal, das eine Anpassung möglich ist, und das + unterstützung findet."
"El vendedor lo ha enviado muy rápido. Lo he comprado para montar unos mandos arcade con Recalbox. Todavía no he acabado de montar la caja del soporte pero las pruebas que he hecho han salido perfectas. Tiene la potencia suficiente como para jugar sin problemas en muchísimos emuladores. He observado que a veces tarda en conectarse a la wifi, pero no sé si problema del hardware o del software. Viene sin fuente de alimentación, cables, tarjeta o disipadores. Pero por este precio es una maravilla. Muy contento con la compra."
"Das Gerät kam bei mir leider nie an, da Hermes das Paket irgendwie verloren hat...  Danke an Amazon für die problemlose Abwicklung.Habe es mir dann Vorort gekauft und begonnen zu basteln :-) - macht Spaß und ist auch dank vielen Anleitungen im Internet für Laien wie mich nützlich.(Keine oder deutlich weniger Werbung im gesamten Netzwerk, dank PiHole zum Beispiel ist ne tolle Sache und betrifft sogar Werbung in Apps, wenn das Handy per WLAN verbunden ist...)"
"un raspberry original , la premiere fois pour moi. un peu compliqué a démarer la premiere fois et la notice un peu faible. un conseil pour installer rabian , formater la carte SD en FAT32. mise a par ca top , mon projet de photobooth est dans la place. Une etoile en moins pour la notice. ( la phopt c'est mon boitier de protection imprimé par mes soins)"
"Hatte erst Bedenken, da 2 von 4 der bestellten Raspberry PI 3 B+ Mainboards in verbeulten Verpackungen kamen, aber nach Einbau in ein 4er Stack, Ausstattung mit systembestückten micro SD-Karten und Anschluß an eine geeignete Stromquelle liefen alle 4 einwandfrei. Man sollte sich vorher ausreichend über das Erstellen eines Systemimages auf einer micro SD-Karte und wie man mit einem Raspberry Pi komuniziert informieren."
Que buen producto excelente calidad
"When I received this product the box was already half-opened. The adhesive on the side had already been peeled apart, presumably by the last buyer who returned the item. The item was held ""shut"" by a label explicitly stating that the item was new. Initially I didn't give much thought to this. However, when I tried plugging in various cables (HDMI, mini-USB, etc.), I noticed that the weren't going fully into the ports of the raspberry Pi (only goes 3/4ths in). When I tried these same cables on other devices (don't have a second Pi to test it out on), they fit perfectly. I'm going to put two and two together and assume that the previous buyer noticed this same defect and returned the item. The seller then tried to sell this defective product again under the guise that it was ""new.""Edit: It seems that the ports are supposed to be like that. However, there is an issue with the 3.5mm port that's preventing from plugging my headphone jack even halfway. Still very disappointed to receive a ""new"" product in this condition."
"easy to use, and works well."
"Ecco, dopo anni in cui ho rimandato, ho deciso finalmente di comprare una Raspberry.Mi fa da:- Server VPN- Media Server- NAS (collegando HDD esterno)- Scudo anti pubblicità(Pi-hole)- Mi invia email segnalandomi se durante la giornata pioverà- Un server di Minetest, versione open source di Minecraft- Un server di PostgreSQLEcco, cosa volere di più? Se si rinuncia all'interfaccia grafica, sappiate che avanzano svariate centinaia di MB di RAM libera. Grazie Raspberry!"
Brought to replace damages pi3
"I got my Pi for PiHole and PiVPN as well as another node in my cloud software. It's been a great investment for all 3 purposes, and I am still looking to make it do more."
"La scheda di per se è ottima e non serve di certo la mia recensione a confermarlo.(Venduto e spedito da Amazon)2 STELLE AD AMAZON invece perché mi ha consegnato un prodotto palesemente già utilizzato, privo addirittura della busta antistatica a protezione di componentistica elettronica delicata.Non è la prima scheda che compro, comunque funziona e me la tengo.Se compro un prodotto nuovo mi aspetto di riceverlo realmente tale."
I got this to run my 3D printer. Runs 24/7 without a glitch.  Good buy.
Die Leistung des 3B+ reicht locker für Heimautomation. Er läuft auch ohne aktiven Lüfter in normalen Temperaturen. Leider ist die USB und Netzwerkgeschwindigkeit nicht sehr hoch. Der Nachfolger 4B kann das besser.
"Der  Pi 3 Modell B+ ist je nach Anwendung merklich schneller als das Modell ohne +.Ich nutze den Pi als Ersatz für eine Homematic CCU2.Gefühlt ist der Pi 200 mal schneller als die original CCU2.Wenn es nicht um jeden Cent geht, lohnt es sich nicht einen Pi2 oder Pi 1 zu kaufen.Ich würde auch den Pi3 ohne B+ nicht empfehlen.Der Pi3 B+ ist wesentlich schneller und kaum teurer."
"Sammlerkauf, deshalb ohne große Bewertung, allerdings war bislang jeder Pi in Leistung und Einsatzmöglichkeit immer deutlich besser als der vorherige..."
"J'ai longtemps hésité avant d'opter pour cette carte : il s'agissait de remplacer mon Mac mini vieillissant, et je cherchais une solution alternative de nano PC. Je ne suis pas déçu. J'ai intégré cette carte RPI dans un boîtier ""element14"" pour constituer un Pi Desktop. Silence, efficacité, cette carte répond à mon attente. J'utilise le système d'exploitation par défaut : Raspbian (debian pour Raspberry Pi)."
"Used this in addition to the Smraza case kit to build my first Rasp Pi project, a Pi Hole to block incoming ad traffic on my home network. Easy peasy, effective, and fun! I look forward to more Rasp Pi projects and will happily purchase this board again."
I have all the previous generation Raspberry Pis and this is definitely the best. Way faster than the previous ones and of course for the price you can beat it. I use these for arcade emulation but plan to do so much more with these.
"J'ai acheté ce RPi pour en faire un serveur OpenVPN + SSH pour accéder à mon réseau local lorsque je ne suis pas chez moi.Comme d'habitude (je dois en avoir 4 ou 5 de la génération 3) aucun soucis avec ces petits ordinateurs qui permettent un grand nombre d'utilisations (serveur Web, rétro-gaming, serveur média, et même PC classique).J'attends juste une version avec USB3 pour pouvoir faire de la sauvegarde de carte SD vers disque USB."
I have 2 p3 b plus one running retropie for games the other running osmc for films they both run great no problemsin all great single board computer
"So much has already been written about these boards, just ensure you get a decent SD card and solid power supply, then get cracking with your projects. Nice."
I finally got around to hooking up a raspberry cam to this B+ and the camera started getting super hot.  I tried the camera on another raspberry pi that I have and it worked fine.  It's then that I noticed the camera ribbon cable connector and the display ribbon cable are populated on the circuit board 180-deg out from the way they are supposed to be.  Trying to contact seller for a refund or replacement.  Be aware if you are intending this for use with a raspberry pi cam to check this connector as soon as you receive the board.
I use this for my retro gaming and it works great I bought one from target Before and it was the model before but it still works this is way faster
This little device is awesome! Currently have Pi-Hole configured on it and it has been working great continuously for weeks. This model is overkill for blocking ads through DNS but it was my first Raspberry Pi. I'm thinking of buying another to serve as a legacy game emulator.
"Il prodotto  era ciò  che mi aspettavo, avendone altri sapevo cosa acquistavo.  purtroppo devo segnalare che la confezione, un semplice cartoncino con all'interno l'oggetto, era visibilmente schiacciato, probabilmente è stato messo sotto una pila di altri pacchi."
Orgianal productGood qualityReally satisfiedIts a fun do some programming Raspberry pi.I am network engineer..its realy useful to some test with python..It will work with normal power bankI am recommending to other Raspberry pi uses
"Works great for octoprint! After my aging Pi2 finally gave up the ghost, I ordered this to run octoprint. It works great! It boots really quickly and connected to my network automatically (the built in wifi is fantastic). Octolapse works wonderfully too!"
Im new to the pi world.  But now that I have built two gaming systems with them and dabbled into programming. I will say these are some really cool little computers.
It is a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and it works as expected. I will not go into details cause there is plenty of info about the Pi 3B+. Just wanted to voice my satisfaction with this purchase here.
"Sélectionné pour ces performances, aucune déception. Le ras-pi 3B+ tient ses promesses. Dommage que la gestion de la mise en route du Bluetooth soit aussi peu aisée. A simplifier dans les versions à venir."
"Der Raspberry Pi ist ein idealer Startpunkt für kleine Bastelprojekte, die einen kleinen Rechner brauchen. Ich versuche mir ein Tablet selber zu bauen auf der Basis des Raspberry Pi"
Ich habe mir den PI geholt um ihn zusammen mit Octoprint und meinem 3D Drucker zu verwenden.Das Paket kam schnell Zuhause an und es war auch alles ordentlich verpackt und auch er Pi war in einer antistatischen Folie verpackt.Funktioniert so wie es soll.Hab absolut nichts zu beanstanden und würde ihn immer wieder kaufen.
"Solid board, with cleanly assembled components - no complaints at all. Fit perfectly in a standard B+ case, and worked like a charm immediately. Much nicer than the old Pi 512MB model it replaced."
"Now I can do all the things I used to when I was younger and so much more.  All those old games, woohoo!"
Cool little gadget  lots of uses  and add-ons  from the magic mirror to my cloud servers  and a weather station i did for my son  things you can do are endless
Aucun problème depuis des mois.Seul le ventilateur fait du bruit.
"Great high quality product, requires a bit of research and reading if you are a newbie getting into computing but well worth it!Works really well as a local Plex server to stream movies and tv shows to home devices! Most of my home devices direct stream so it works well without the need for transcoding."
"Easy to order, Fast delivered. Best quality. Recommendable."
Nutze meine pis als ts server und dropbox. Und einen als retropi ... geplant ist auch noch der kauf eines pi4 wenn ich endlich weis wofür XD
Funciona muy bien aunque el indicador de energía siempre está encendido aunque utilices una fuente con el mínimo recomendado. Además algún OS se me queda colgado cuando le exiges un poco.
"La gamma dei Raspberry PI va evolvendo lentamente, ma il prodotto è sempre facile da usare ed estremamente stabile. Anche questo modello, con Gigabit Ethernet, un wi-fi migliorato e un processore che scalda meno, quindi mantiene le prestazioni anche sotto ""sforzo"", è eccellente, senza sorprese: si scarica il sistema operativo dal sito e si parte subito senza problemi."
"Do NOT but this if you want to build your own stratux, unless you want to compile from source... Get a 3B instead, not a 3B+ ...."
"buona versatilità,  buon imballaggio,  e facile da controllare in remoto"
"Preso per autocostruirmi un music server con DAC Justboom e monitor touch da 7"" raspberry (quelli di marca costano veramente troppo) e mi sembra di aver trovato un buon rapporto qualità prezzo.Ovviamente questo perchè il mio impianto HIFI è un po vintage ..... per sistemi più evoluti non posso giudicare."
fonctionne parfaitement. J'avais déjà le modèle 3B. J'ai installé un OS Rasbian et l'appplication Pi-Hole. Je l'alimente avec un adaptateur PoE externe.  Attention à prendre un adaptateur PoE fonctionnant en Gigabyte car sinon problème de négotiation. J'avais un adaptateur PoE 10/100Bt  et cela ne fonctionnait pas. L'adaptateur est bcp moins cher que la carte additionnelle PoE HAT.
"-  es wird aber daran gearbeitet. Ein 4.18 Kernel sollte es schon sein, ansonsten funktioniert die Ethernet-Anbindung nicht richtig. Bis dahin nutze ich notgedrungen Raspbian (armhf), werde aber bei der ersten Gelegenheit auf arm64 umstellen. Wolfram wird es mir verzeihen..."
Buy a kit for it fun to play with.
"Für die Steuerung meines 3D-Druckers mittels Octroprint habe ich mir einen weiteren Raspberry Pi, diesmal das Modell 3 B+, gekauft. Wie von den Vorgängermodellen gewohnt ist die Platine sehr gut verarbeitet und bootet jetzt auch problemlos, ohne SD-Karte, von einer, per USB angeschlossenen, ehemaligen 250GB Laptop SATA-Festplatte. Das 5GHz WLan funktioniert sehr gut. Beide Daumen hoch!"
"He comprado esta placa para empezar a hacer algún experimento con ella. En particular, me atrae la idea de montar una máquina de juegos arcade estilo ""Retro"".Las primeras pruebas han ido genial. La placa tiene un rendimiento muy bueno, y la verdad es que estoy fascinado de que, con lo poco que vale y la ridiculez de consumo eléctrico que tiene, tengas un mundo de posibilidades con ella."
"Bien que le Pi 4 soit là depuis des mois, le Pi 3 est pour mes applications (domoticz + pihole) plus que largement suffisant. De plus, celui-ci m'a était livré avec un PCB bleu magnifique, c'est la dernière version du Pi 3 B+"
Excellent produit très fiable et qui fonctionne parfaitement.
"Works great.  I have 2.  Pne as a headless Pi-Hole and one with a 3.2"" Waveshare screen.  fun fun fun to play with."
Who doesn't love a good Raspberry Pi? These things are cheap and perfect for retrogaming! Especially in an Arcade 1up cabinet?
"Me monté una VPN para probarla y la tuve funcionando varios meses para conectar a wifis públicas.Luego le instalé Kodi y va lento, pero aceptable.Ahora la tengo con emuladores antiguos."
"Une alternative pour héberger un site internet, une application de formations en e-learning ...Associé à une carte SD de 64G et le petit kit comprenant l'alimentation, le boitier et le ventilateur ... c'est un petit compagnon très utile lors de formations itinérantes ... pas besoins de se connecter à internet .... pensez-y !"
"Rispetto al RPi B+ che era inchiodata questo modello diventa utilizzabile. Ci sono alternative con hardware comparabile o anche migliore ma i tempi di spedizione sono più lunghi, e si aggiunge il ""rischio"" dogana."
"Ich glaube man braucht nicht viel mehr zu diesem Raspberry 3+ schreiben. Das Gerät kann in vielen Bereichen eingesetzt werden z.B. Smarthome, DynDNS Server, VPN und vieles mehr. Dank der um den Raspberry entstanden großen Community kommen ständig neue Einsatzgebiete dazu"
Toller Einplatinencomputer für DIY Projekte. Einsetzbar für Technikanfänger um in Linux-Distributionen und Programmier Erfahrung zu erhalten. Jede neuere Version wird immer Leistungsfähiger um das Board für anspruchsvollere Projekte wie Spieleemulation oä. Performanter zu machen. Für Bastler oder für technikinteressierte eine Kaufempfehlung.
"Ich nutze mein Raspery Pi als kleinen mini Server und muss sagen, ich bin etwas erstaunt wie schnell es doch ist. Bin sehr zufrieden damit. Nur etwas Schade, dass nicht standardmäßig eine Hülle mit kommt."
It's a little faster. Had an issue with start up. The seller got me up and running. Make sure you get the latest NOOBS 2.7.0 for first boot to support B+.
"Es la original,buen precio. Nueva. Llevo 2 para varios ptoyectos que tenia. Lo que no comprendo que me ha llegado la placa en color azul y las que veo son verdes. La presentacion no es su punto fuerte eso si,en una caja decarton fina y sin proteger."
"Fonctionne comme prévu, super outil de DIY, j'enlève simplement une étoile car la boîte contenant le raspberry était esquintée"
"Very good. The delivery was very fast. The product came perfect, new, sealed and works great."
Todo bien.pero la placa es azul en vez de verde.no sé si eso tiene algo que ver.una pasada que puedas hacerte una consola retro y muchas cosas más x lo que cuesta.y a falta de que saquen para la 4 soporte es una buena eleccion
"Endlich mit mehr Netzwerkdurchsatz, ein wenig mehr Leistung ist auch schön. Die POE-Versorgung hab ich noch nicht getestet.--> Wenn man einen PI kauft dann diesen, aber ein Upgrade von nem Pi3 B und B+ lohnt sich nur in den seltensten Fällen."
Der Raspberry Pi 3 Modell B+ bietet alles was man so braucht. Man kann wirklich sehr viele Projekte damit realisieren und der Raspberry Pi läuft durchweg stabil.
Was easy to program the installation and has worked perfect for several weeks now. Linked right up to 5 Ghz WIFI and the CPU runs cool.
I have many of these and they are super useful and perform well.
"Raspberry Pi, einfach super.Für alle die noch mit dem Pi 1 unterwegs sind.Das Ding hat richtig Power. Vor allem bei Python Skripte mit while, true schleifen."
Great to run my own web server and work on projects with
Hab mir nach langem überlegen meinen ersten Raspberry gekauft und muss sagen es hat sich gelohnt!Der Kleinstcomputer hat mich voll überzeugt und ist seitdem in Dauerbetrieb als Media-Center/Server. Das Geld absolut wert!
"This doesn't fit the Raspberry Pi 3 B+, and the quality of the case is very poor (seems incredibly fragile). The power cable and fan are great though."
"Acheté pour mes parents,  il y a 2 ans, ils en sont très contents."
bonjour a tous  une très bon produis et je dirai même  qu il es mieux que le p3b il répond bien il a était livrer avant la date qui et très bien
The kids loving playing rpi games all day.
"Sehr gutes Produkt. Wesentlich schneller als Raspberry 1. Nutze ihn als 3D-Druckerserverver (mit Octoprint). Instalation, Inbetriebnahme etc. haben reibungslos funktioniert. Alles bestens. Sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Sehr schön ist die integrierte WLAN Funktionaltät."
Assieme al raspberry ed a un Commodore 64 originale mi sono creato una COMMODORE  STATION hdmi perfetta attraverso VICE emulator.....fantastico !!!Raspberry è davvero un prodotto stupendo affidabile e piccolissimo :)
"incuriosito dal mondo di questi ""minipc"" ho deciso di acquistare questa raspberry pi 3+, per il momento l'ho utilizzata solo con raspbian+kodi e sono contento, è molto reattiva. ma gli utilizzi sono i più svariati: server vpn, mediacenter, nas, domotica, e tanti altri."
"Si è aperto un mondo! Io ho installato un mediacenter di pubblico dominio. Ma a disposizione ci sono moltissime applicazioni per soddisfare ogni esigenza. E se ancora manca, prima o poi qualcuno la realizzerà. Lhardware è stabile e migliore di tante cineserie preconfezionate"
Ich nutze den Raspbery Pi als Homematic Server und für lokale Netzwerkanwendungen. Die Qualität ist super und der Einplatinen-PC der dritten Generation ist ein kleiner Alleskönner.
Muy buen precio
"Contento con esta Raspberry, ya la habia probado antes y va de lujo."
Great new dual band wifi Pi with a little extra boost where needed. Boots 8sec quicker and overclocks fine.
Cracking piece of technology.
"Works nicely! Heatsinks and fans not necessarily needed, but good power is a must!Many cheap ones won't work, so be careful!"
"Prodotto arrivato nella sua confezione originale. Ottimo dispositivo didattico per approcciarsi al mondo della programmazione, utilizzabile per la domotica, per creare dei mini server o nas domestici e tanto altro ancora."
"Che dire l'ultima versione funziona alla grande anche se avrei voluto un octa core e una porta m.2 e possibilmente 4 gb di ram, ma forse verrà implementato nella 4a versione."
rapporto qualità prezzo impeccabili.
"TOP Produkt, und sehr gutes Preis / Leistungsverhältnis. Der Raspberry macht Spass für Leute die etwas Zeit in die Sache investieren. Ganz klare Kaufempfehlung."
"amazing and smaal console, Im very happy with my toy"
"Parfait, tout le monde devait avoir un raspberry chez soi. Une fois bien configuré vous ne lâcherai plus ce petit bijou :)"
Funciona perfectamente
serious hobby fruit
Love the raspberry pi.
Raspberry pi 3 B+: funktioniert einwandfrei
good
Tolles ProduktWir wir sind super zufrieden mit dem kleinen Mini pc
So many project and so few pi. What a little power unit
Muy bueno. Gran precio.
good
Pour de la domotique avec jeedom
Every iteration = better
Attention cela n'est pas précisé mais ce produit n'est pas encore compatible avec le système recalbox et donc pas encore éligible a l'émulation de console rétro
Ich benutze Raspberry Pi für verschiedenen Projekte. Bisher funktioniert es gut.
Fonctionne très bien je l'utilise sur 2 support nafabox pour astrophoto et recalbox
"La caja me vino hecha polvo por culpa de los repartidores, pero por suerte la Pi3 está intacta, la banda 5GHz funciona genial."
"Die Verpackung des Raspberry kam beschädigt an und war schon teilweise geöffnet, Gerät funktioniert jedoch."
Very good product.
"Parfait fonctionne très bien , bonne qualté de fabrication"
Alles bestens
Un buon prodotto per affacciarsi al mondo Linux.
Il dispositivo é perfettoÉ comunque consigliato acquistare un case con ventola per il raffreddamento
l'instalaltion de linux sur le rasp berry pi 3 etait tres simplesilencieux et facile à installerdonc merci encore
"Acheté pour monter une plateforme de retro-gaming, je suis ravi !!!Foncez !!!"
Muy útil para dar aplicación a muchos proyectos.
Funciona a la perfección. Retropi emula casi sin bajones supermario 64 y super smash brosh sin necesidad de overclock.
Produit conforme avec des capacités impressionnantes pour ça taille. Pas de micro sd incluses.
Buon prezzo e velocità di consegna
Un mini ordinateur pour un prix imbattable !
Conforme à la description
Mi è arrivato oggi ma non riesco a farlo partire.....qualcuno lo ha provato con il Retropie? Ho provato anche l'ultima versione ma rimane la luce rossa.....

"Bonjour, Le raspberry envoyé ne fonctionne pas. J'ai testé avec plusieurs cartes sd, plusieurs images, plusieurs cables hdmi, plusieurs alimentations.... Il n'y a rien a en tiré, écran noir. Rien ne s'affiche. Apparemment je ne suis pas le seul a avoir rencontré des problèmes avec ce produit. Si ça se trouve il n'est même pas neuf... inadmissible."
The box was open when I received it so who knows how old it really is
Non più funzionante dopo nemmeno 6 mesi di utilizzo.Il venditore non risponde alle mie richieste per restituire il prodotto in garanzia.
Bonjour sur ma commande de 4 RP3b+ j'ai un RP3 qui ne fonctionne pas comment cela se passe ?Vous me renvoyez 1 piece ?Cordialement
"Scrivo questa recensione allarrivo del secondo raspberry ordinato... entrambi i raspberry ricevuti non funzionano entrambi con luce rossa fissa.... in più il secondo arrivato a mio parere DI SECONDA MANO confezione del tutto danneggiata, senza pellicole sopra i componenti... insomma sono deluso, ho aspettato tanto e sono costretto a fare nuovamente il reso... ma questa volta non so se ordinare nuovamente questo o prendere il modello precedente..."

Wenn eine externe Spannungsquelle angeschlossen ist und nicht das USB Kabel, dann wird an 5V Ausgang und GPIO Pins nur 3,3 V ausgegeben.Mit den PWM Ausgänge habe ich aktuell weitere Probleme, bevor ich nur auf Suche nach Qualitätsfehler bin und mein Projekt zu viel Zeit in Anspruch nimmt, kaufe ich direkt bei Arduino.cc ein.', 'If small electronics are your things.
