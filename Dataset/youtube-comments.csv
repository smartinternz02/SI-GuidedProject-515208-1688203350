Moinak Ghosh,"@M M Honestly even if there are, I am not aware. The ease of getting started with EI opens up many possibilities, especially for researchers in signal processing, not familiar with AI/ML. Another point worth mentioning is that the lower memory footprint allows more inference at the edge, which in turn opens up many domains of research previously beyond the reach of the average researcher.",2021-05-04T16:05:43Z,2,

Ricardo Sand√≠,Tks a lot!! Is it posible to Connect 2 arduino a ble 33 iot using the ble library?,2022-04-10T22:13:21Z,0,1
Robocraze,"Hey, thank you! Unfortunately, we have not tried it yet. If you could provide more details of the library we can maybe do some exploration",2022-04-11T06:51:44Z,1,
Kevin McDonald,"I am attempting to duplicate this project for learning purposes, but I am a bit confused about 1 thing. I am able to get the code up and running and connected to the nrf connect app. However in the values field I only receive the hex value never the actual string. What do you think causes this? (I am using an iPhone)",2022-04-06T00:22:45Z,0,1
Robocraze,"You can try manually converting the hex values to string to check if the values you are receiving is indeed correct. If it is correct, then the issue is with the nRF app settings as its not doing the conversion process due to probably some incorrect settings on the app",2022-04-12T07:39:25Z,0,
abdul hamid,"Hi, nice vidio, but i want to ask you how about send over ble sense and ble device as peripheral and central. how can send float data?",2022-03-17T06:31:02Z,0,0
jeff,"I am having trouble believing that this is a proper BLE solution since your USB cable remained connected to your computer the whole time. Your nRF Connect showed the sensor data which was the same as that from the serial monitor. I need the Arduino to connect to the nRF Connect but without being attached to the computer, and the signal does not advertise in this case. I'm trying to discover a fix for this, but I would appreciate any ideas from this community. Thanks",2021-10-18T22:10:34Z,1,1
Robocraze,"The nano is connected to the computer solely for power purposes. You can connect the same setup directly to the power adaptor and achieve the same results.
nRF data shows the same serial because the same device sends both to serial and Bluetooth. It was shown for verification.",2021-12-07T05:19:58Z,0,

James Gregor,"Very good series. However, I get incorrect temperature values with the code as written and I don't know what the problem is. The Serial.begin(9600) after initializing the sensors seems to screw up the temperature values. To correct this, I move the serial initialization to the beginning of setup().

Does anyone have an explanation for this?",2021-05-29T14:48:37Z,0,1
Robocraze,"Oh, interesting. Do you have any other components connected to the Nano while you did your test? And what kind of temeprature values are you getting?",2021-06-08T08:23:43Z,0,
